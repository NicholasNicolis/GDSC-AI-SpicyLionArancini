78 9Long long ago, in a small house  near the forest , there 
lived a little girl  with her mother . Her name was Little 
Red Riding Hood .
One day, her mother  said:
“Grandma  is sick. She’s in bed . Go to her house . In the 
basket , there’s a bottle of fresh milk , some bread  and 
some butter  for her.”
Little Red Riding Hood  immediately set out for grandmother’s 
house . But in the forest , she met a hungry Wolf .
“Where are you going?” said the Wolf .
“To see my grandmother ,” said innocent Little Red Riding 
Hood ; “she’s sick. I have some milk, bread  and butter  for her.”
“Pick some flowers ,” said the Wolf . And he ran to 
grandmother’s house .

The Wolf  got to grandmother’s house . He went tap-tap-
tap on the door.
“Who is this?” asked Grandma .
“It’s me, Little Red Riding Hood ,” said the Wolf ; “I have 
some milk, bread  and butter  for you.”
“Open the door  and come in , my dear,” said Grandma .
The Wolf  opened the door and, in an instant, he ate her 
up! Then, he got into grandma’s bed  to wait for Little 
Red Riding Hood .
Little Red Riding Hood  got to grandmother’s house . She

14Snow White
and
the Seven Dwarfs16 17Part One
Once upon a time there was a little princess …
She was called Snow White  because she was white  as 
snow . Her lips were red as blood . And her hair was black  
as night . She was a beautiful girl , sweet  and gentle .
She lived in a palace  with her father  and her stepmother : 
the King  and the Queen .
The Queen  was a beautiful woman . But she was wicked  
and vain.
Every day, the Queen  looked in her magic mirror  and asked:
“Mirror, mirror on the wall,
Who’s the fairest of all?”
And every day, the mirror  answered:
“You, my Queen! You are!
You are the most beautiful of all.”
Time passed and little  Snow White  became a beautiful  
young lady . Everybody loved her.
One morning, when the Queen  asked her magic mirror :
“Mirror, mirror on the wall,
Who’s the fairest of all?”
18 19The mirror  answered:
“My Queen, you are beautiful, it’s true!
But Snow White is more beautiful  than you.”
The Queen  was furious ! She planned a horrible crime.
She called a huntsman  and commanded him:
“Take Snow White  deep into the forest … and kill her !”
“But… Your Majesty! The beloved Princess!” he said.
“Kill Snow White ! And take out her heart ,” the Queen  
commanded again.
Part Two
The huntsman  took Snow White  deep into the woods .
“Forgive me, my Princess… I have orders from the Queen 
to kill you! But I can’t do that !” he said.
“Oh, good man!” she cried, “I’ll run into the forest  and 
I’ll never come back !”
Snow White  ran and ran through the dark forest . She 
was so scared ! Then, she found a little house . The door  
was open . She went in.20 21A little table  was set for dinner: seven little chairs , seven 
little bowls , seven little spoons , seven little knives , seven 
little forks , and seven little mugs .
Snow White  was hungry  and thirsty . She thought:
“I’ll have a little bread  from each bowl . And I’ll drink a 
little wine  from each mug .”
Then, feeling so tired , she lay down on one of the seven 
little beds . And she fell asleep. 
In the morning, she woke up  and saw the seven masters 
of the house  looking at her. They were seven dwarfs .
“Who are you ?” they asked.
“My name is Snow White ,” she answered.  And she told 
them the whole story  about the wicked Queen .
“Princess Snow White, you can stay,” the Dwarfs said. 
“Can you help us cook and clean ?”
“Yes! I can cook  and I can wash . And I can make beds ,” 
she said happily.
“Please, remember: don’t open the door to strangers !” 
said the Dwarfs. “The Queen  will find you.”23
Part Three
At the Palace, the Queen  asked her magic mirror :
“Mirror, mirror on the wall,
Who’s the fairest of all?”
The mirror  answered:
“My Queen, you are beautiful, it’s true!
But Snow White is more beautiful  than you.
In the mountains, she dwells
And she is still alive and well.”
The Queen  was absolutely furious ! “I will kill Snow 
White  myself!” she thought.
She made a deadly poison . Then, she put the poison  in a 
beautiful red apple .
The Queen , dressed in old clothes , went to the little 
house in the mountains . She knocked on the door, 
calling:  
“APPLES! JUICY APPLES! APPLES FOR SALE!”
Snow White  answered: “I’m sorry, madam. I can’t open 
the door  to strangers.”
“Oh, I’m just an old woman ! Open the window  and take 
one apple ,” said the Queen .
Snow White  opened the window , took the apple  and 
had one bite. She fell dead to the floor !
“Now, I’m the most beautiful  of all. Ha, ha, ha!” the 
Queen  said and she ran away.24 25
Back at the Palace, the Queen  ran to her magic mirror :
“Mirror, mirror on the wall,
Who’s the fairest of all?”
The mirror  answered:
“You, my Queen! You are!
You are the most beautiful of all.”
The wicked Queen  was happy  now because the magic 
mirror  never lied.
Part Four
The Seven Dwarfs  found S now White dead on the floor .
In her honor, they made her a glass coffin  and placed it 
on top of a mountain .
One day, a young Prince  stopped to see her. And he fell 
in love  with  Snow White. With a kiss, she came back to a 
new life  with her Prince.
Snow White  and the Prince  had a big wedding . Everyone 
was invited  to the celebration . Even the wicked Queen !
And that night, when the Queen saw Snow White, she 
choked  with envy and hate. And she fell dead to the floor . 
The Prince and the Princess lived happily ever after …
THE ENDWhat’s a Folktale?
About the Stories in this Book
You have read two popular folktales  in English: Little Red 
Riding Hood  and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Folktales  
is the name for very popular stories of oral tradition  around 
the world. These stories pass down from one generation  
to the next generation : from parents to children and from 
grandparents to grandchildren. And from teachers to 
students!
Folktales  have a long life in popular culture. Their origins  and 
authors are now lost. It is possible that there was not one 
origin  or one author . Probably, folktales had several origins  
and several authors  across time and across cultures. This 
26means multiple contributors  in time and space. So, variations  
in the stories are inevitable .
Little Red Riding Hood  and Snow White  are two of the most 
famous  stories  in the world . They have been told and read 
millions of times in different languages : French, English, 
Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and the list goes on and on. We 
can find variations  in the stories: the elements  in the basket , 
the tricks  of the wolf , the tricks  of the wicked  Queen and the 
endings !
Folktales  are fun for children and adults. They have been a 
common voice  over the centuries : Aladdin , Ali Baba and the 
Forty Thieves , Hansel and Gretel , Stone Soup , The Gingerbread 
Man … and so many more!
Pick one… and keep reading ! 
2728 29Into the Forest
In stories for children, the forest  is a symbol of danger 
and adventure. Little Red Riding Hood  goes into the 
forest, Hansel and Gretel  go into the forest, Snow White  
goes into the forest, too. And in the forest, they meet 
the Big Bad Wolf , the cruel Witch  or the Seven Dwarfs .
What is so fascinating about them? One possible answer 
is that forests  are full of magic , mystery  and horror . 
In books, the residents of the woods  are monsters , 
dragons , bears , trolls , giants  and more! Children -and 
adults- love to read scary stories .
In the past, real forests  were a real danger for children: 
there were bandits  and wild animals . Adults told stories 
to children to teach them a lesson: Don’t go into the 
forest alone! Or the wolf will eat you up!  Just like Little 
Red Riding Hood  in one of the traditional endings 
written by Charles Perrault in 1697.
In classic tales, forests  are a mystery . Deep into the 
wood , anything is possible: talking animals , candy 
houses , and friendly dwarfs . There is no limit to fantasy  
and horror . And, maybe, this is the reason why we love 
these classics so much. They are an open door into the 
enchanted forest . We read the classics to enter the 
woods  again and again and again.
