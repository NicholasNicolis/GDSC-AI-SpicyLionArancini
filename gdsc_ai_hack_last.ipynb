            "An expert-level exercise to test your knowledge about concurrency primitives in operating systems could involve designing and implementing a complex system that requires careful coordination of threads or processes.

            "\n",
            "### Exercise: Implementing a Multithreaded File Download Manager\n",
            "\n",
            "**Objective:**\n",
            "Design and implement a multithreaded download manager in C or C++ that can handle multiple simultaneous downloads from different URLs. The download manager should efficiently manage network and disk I/O operations, handle synchronization between threads, and ensure data integrity.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Requirements:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Concurrency:**\n",
            "   - The download manager must support downloading up to 10 files concurrently from different URLs.\n",
            "   - Each download should be handled by a separate thread.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Thread Synchronization:**\n",
            "   - Use mutexes, semaphores, or other synchronization primitives to manage access to shared resources (e.g., updating the download status).\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Deadlock Avoidance:**\n",
            "   - Implement a strategy to avoid potential deadlocks that could arise from the concurrent operations.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Error Handling:**\n",
            "   - The system should be robust against network errors and handle them gracefully (e.g., retries, timeouts).\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Progress Tracking:**\n",
            "   - Implement functionality to track and report the progress of each download.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Resource Management:**\n",
            "   - Ensure that the system does not exhaust system resources (e.g., file descriptors, memory).\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **User Interface:**\n",
            "   - Create a simple text-based interface that allows users to:\n",
            "     - Add new download URLs.\n",
            "     - View the progress of ongoing downloads.\n",
            "     - Cancel specific downloads.\n",

            "**Steps:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Design:**\n",
            "   - Outline the architecture of your download manager, including the main components and their interactions.\n",
            "   - Decide on the concurrency model and synchronization mechanisms you will use.\n",
            "   - Plan how you will handle potential errors and edge cases in network communication and file I/O.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Implementation:**\n",
            "   - Set up the basic multithreading framework.\n",
            "   - Implement the network communication module to handle HTTP requests and responses.\n",
            "   - Design the data structures and synchronization primitives for managing download progress and thread coordination.\n",
            "   - Implement the user interface commands.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Testing:**\n",
            "   - Write test cases to cover various scenarios, including simultaneous downloads, error conditions, and system resource limits.\n",
            "   - Test for race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Optimization:**\n",
            "   - Profile the application to find bottlenecks.\n",
            "   - Optimize the synchronization mechanisms and thread management to improve performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Documentation:**\n",
            "   - Document the design decisions, architecture, and usage instructions.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Advanced Challenges:**\n",
            "- Extend the download manager to support pause and resume of downloads.\n",
            "- Implement rate limiting to control the bandwidth used by the download manager.\n",
            "- Add support for downloading files from FTP servers.\n",

Specifically, the calculation of the `end` byte for each thread might overlap, causing each thread to download a slightly overlapping segment of the file. This error can lead to corrupted files because parts of the file might be written twice or the file parts might not align correctly.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Recommendations to Avoid the Error\n",
            "1. **Correct Byte Range Calculation:**\n",
            "   Ensure that the byte ranges assigned to each thread do not overlap except at the boundary where one thread's range ends and another begins. Adjust the range calculation by subtracting one from the end byte of each range (except the last one).\n",
            "\n",
            "   Replace:\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   end = start + part_size if i < num_threads - 1 else file_size\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "   With:\n",
            "   ```python\n",
            "   end = start + part_size - 1 if i < num_threads - 1 else file_size - 1\n",
            "   ```\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Use a Thread-Safe Mechanism for Writing to the File:**\n",
            "   Instead of storing results in a list and writing them at the end, consider using a thread-safe method like writing each part directly to its position in the file. This can be achieved using file seek operations within each thread, ensuring that the file writes do not interfere with each other.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Testing and Validation:**\n",
            "   After implementing the download manager, it's crucial to test with files of various sizes and ensure the integrity of the downloaded file matches the original. Tools like checksum or hash comparison can be useful for validation.\n",
