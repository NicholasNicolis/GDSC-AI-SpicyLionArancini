Hi! I'm 24 years old and I'm attending University.
        I would like to study, 
        and in particular: I usually studying repeating various time the chapters of books. And I usually don't do schemas.
        I commonly tend to study in a specific way, following this methodology: not really, because I received many bad marks.
        My goals are: I want to pass exam about a short english story.
        These are my information on how i study and how i approach gaining new knowledge.
